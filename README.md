# Enigma_Simulator
An Enigma machine simulator written in Java that implements a substitution cipher on the letters of an input message. Project 1 for UC Berkeley's CS61B class "Data Structures" Spring 2022. This submission recieved full credit as well as full marks for extra credit assignment. 

The program takes in the input file from the left and cyphers them into the text on the right. It mimics the mechanisms of an Enigma machine by putting each letter of the message through a series of moving rotors, fixed rotors, reflectors, and pluboards, each component mapping a letter to another letter based on the permutation of the rotor. This program also supports the option to specify a unique alphabet to use, which can be any series of characters. Additional details on the functionality of the program can be found at https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/proj/proj1/index.html. To view the code, please contact me at madelinedm@berkeley.edu as academic integrity policies prohibit me from publicly posting it.

The input file should contain the rotor names to use, initial rotor settings, optional additional plugboard permutations, and the messages to convert.
